    The Document Object Model is a platform- and language-neutral interface that 
    will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
    structure and style of documents. The document can be further processed and 
    the results of that processing can be incorporated back into the presented page.
    The Documement can be HTML, XHTML, or XML

   - Styles
     RPC - Remote Procedure Calls
     SOA - Service-Oriented Architecture

+ Storing state Information
  - Cookies 
    Stored on the client
    useful for if you need to have that data for months 
    Cookies are sent evertime the page is loaded 

  - Session 
    Stored on the client but needs a small cookie to store the unquic ID or an ID in the URL
    Lasts of until the user exits the browser

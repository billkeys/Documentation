+ Overall
+ ---------------------

+ Features of Client side JavaScript
  - Control Document Appearance and Content
  - Control The browser
  - Interact with HTML Forms
  - Interact with the User - ie with Event Handlers
  - Read and Write Client State with Cookies
+ What it can't do
  - no graphics other then dynamically generating HMTL
  - no reading or writing of file for security reasons
  - no networking support like sockets
+ Other
  - every implement ation og JavaScript always have a global object at the head
    global properties ie fields or variables

+ When to use javascript
  - Event
    click, double clicks, mouse enters mouse exits, key presses
  - Browser access
    window sizing 
 + ECMAScript
   - core of javascrip that describes the language syntax and basic objects
  
+ Client Side JavaScript
+ -----------------------------------------------------------
  + The web Browser Environment
    - Features
      1. Window Object - browser window, global object and global execution context
                         Its at the root (window.document. ...) //current window document
      2. DOM and client-side object hierarchy - represent the HTML Document
      3. Event-driven programming model - never use document.write() because it will 
                                          override the current document with a new one
  + Embedding Scripts int HMTL
    1. JavaScript code between <script> </script>
    2. external file specified by the srv attribute of <script> tab
    3. in an event handler as a value of an HMTL attribute like onclick
   4. In URL javascript: protocol

  + Manipulating the Document During Loading
    - When to do edit the Document with for example document.write() is a debate 
      can depend on the browser
    - Consensus that existing is it's safe to manipulate the document once the 
     onload event has been triggered

+ Scripting HTTP (ie AJAX)
+ --------------------------------------------------
  + Some ways of doing Scripting HTTP
    - <img>, <iframe> <script> use the src property
    - XMLHttpRequest Object which provides addess to HTTP protocol
  + Using XMLHttpRequest
    - XMLRequestion is not limited to just using xml document it 
      can fetch any kind of text document
    - Steps:
      1. create XMLHttpRequest object
         var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      2. specifying and submitting your HTTP request to the web server
         request.open("GET", url, false); // POST or HEAD (gets info about doc) can be used
         request.setRequestHeader(....
         request.send(null);//use null if using GET if POST put what is send to the server
      3. synchronously or asynchrously retrieving the server's response  
    
    - Asynchronous Response
      request.open(...,true)
      notification of a response is handled by an event handler
      event handler property is onreadystatechange function which is called
      when readyState is changed so we need to check readyState for it's value
    - Notes
      there is no standardized XMLHttpRequest Object so each browser does it a 
      little different

   + HTTP POST
     - Overall
       data is put in the body of HTTP rather then in GET in the URL
       used when the request changes the state of the server
     - How to 
       HTTP.post();

    + Ajaxs and Dynamic Scripting
      - uses scripted HTTP to commentate with a web server without causing pages
        to reload.
      - XML is optional for encoding data
      - hidden data might be better because you don't need make more request to 
       the server then needed

+ HTML DOM
+ ---------------------------------------
 - HTML Document Object Model (DOM) is the browser's view of an HTML page
   as an object hierarchy, starting with the browser window itself and moving
   deeper into the page, including all of the elements on the page and their attributes. The hierarchy contains nodes.
 
 - W3C began working on the DOM
      Window
        |
     document
        |
   forms  anchors   images
    |
    textboxes,
    radio buttons, etc

 - JavaScript is used to manipulate or get information about objects in the HTML DOM. However it's not Javascript specifit.

+ The Brower Object Model (BOM)
+ ------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Allows access and manipulation of the browser window.
  - Only part javascript implemenation that has no related standard.
  - Deals with Windows and frames
  - support for cookies
  - Some standard like having window object and navigator object but 
    each browser has it's own properties and methods on thos objects
  
+ JavaScript Syntax (ECMAScript)
+ ------------------------------------------------------------------
  + Core
    - Everything is case-sensitive
    - Varibles are loosely typed. ie no types
      var num = 25;
    - End-of-line semicolons are optional.
      but some browsers need to have ;
    - comments are same as java, C and Perl
    - Braces indicate code blocks
    
    
  1. Statements end with semi-colons  ;
  2. case sensitive
  3. comments
     //
     /*  */

  4. objects reference using dot notation
     window.document.loginform
     window.document.forms[0]
  5. objects reference using square bracket notation
     window['document']['loginform']
     window['document']['form[0]']
   
+ Where Javascript code written
+ ------------------------------------------------------
  written inline ie withing HTML tags called event handlers in script blocks
  Example.
    JavaScript.html
    <html>
    <head>
     <title>JavaScript Page</title>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        window.alert("The page is loading");
       </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p align="center">
       <span onclick="document.bgColor = 'red';">Red</span> |
       <span onclick="document.bgColor = 'white';">White</span>
      </p>
     <script type="text/javascript" src="Script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>     
  
  Script.js
    document.write("Hello, there!");


+ Objects
  - Objects have methods ( actions, opening a window)
    window.alert()

  - Proerties (attributes or qualities like color or size)
    document.bgColor = 'red'
  - implict window object
    For example, 
      window.document.write()  is equal to  document.write(). 
      Likewise, window.alert() can be shortened to just alert().
   
   - The getElementById() Method
      used to reference HTML elements by their ID use getElementById()
   - Examples
     Location - allows you to download and display the contents of any URL in any
                window or frame of the browser
     History  - allows you to move forward and back within the user;s browsing history
     Window   -  allows JavaScript to display arbitrary messages to the user in the 
                 status line of any browser window 

+ Event Handlers
  - Are attributes that force an element to "listen" 
    for a specific event to occur.
  - begin with the letters "on". 

  - Example 
    We used the onclick event handler to call JavaScript code that changed
    the background color of the page

+ variables
  var age;
  age = 26;

+ Loosely typed Language
   don't specify data types of a variable

+ Storing user entered data
  <script type="text/javascript">
    //Pop up a prompt
    var USER_COLOR = window.prompt("Enter a color.", "");
   </script>

   <script type="text/javascript">
     document.write(USER_COLOR);
   </script>


+ arrays
  var myarray = new Array();
  //or 
  var myarray = [];
  // assignment
  myarray[0] = value1;

 //or 
 var myarray = new Array(value1, value2, value3);
 //or, using the [] notation:
 var myarray = [value1, value2, value3]


+ Methods
  
   function changeBg(color){
     return   document.bgColor = color;
    }

+ Contitions and Loops
 - If statment
   if (age >= 21) {
     alert("You can vote and drink!");
   } else if (age >= 18) {
     alert("You can vote, but can't drink.");
   } else {
      alert("You cannot vote or drink.");
   }
  
 - switch/case 
   var QUANTITY = 1;
   
   switch (QUANTITY) {
     case 1 :
       alert("QUANTITY is 1");
     case 2 :
       alert("QUANTITY is 2");
       brea;
     default :
        alert("QUANTITY is not 1 or 2");
      }

 - while
   while (conditions) {
    statements;
   }

  - do while
   do {
     statements;
   } while (conditions);

  - for loop
   for (initialization; conditions; change) {
     statements;
    }

  - for in
    for (var item in array) if (array.hasOwnProperty(item)) {
     statements;
    }

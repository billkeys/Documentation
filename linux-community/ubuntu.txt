+ ------------------------------------
 1. Reporting
 2. Triage
 3. Analysis
 4. A: Forward  B: Fix locally
 5. Package fix
 6. Deploy fix

Tips for doing bugs forwarding
 - Do s query on bugs marked Confirmed or Triaged, Not Reported Upstream, and sort by most recently changed first
 - make sure that the bug has been tested on the latest unstream code
 - make sure launchpad bug includes all relevant information, including log files, backtraces, etc
 - re-state the problem in 2-3 sentences up top in the bug report description
 - URL back to the launchpad bug 
 - launchpad bug, I click “Also affects project” and place the upstream bug URL there.
 - Put a comment into the launchpad bug asking the reporter to subscribe to the 
   upstream bug report, in case upstream has further questions or needs someone to test something.
 - If upstream produces a patch, then the next step would be to grab the patch 
  and attach it to the bug report. This flags step #5 to proceed.
